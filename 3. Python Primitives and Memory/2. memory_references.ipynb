    "2. What does `id(x)` return in CPython? What does this tell us about where the object lives?\n",
    "3. In C++, you can't call a method on an `int`. Why can you in Python? What fundamental difference makes this possible?\n",
    "4. What is the difference between **identity** and **equality** in Python? Which operator checks each one?\n",
    "5. Why is `a is b` sometimes `True` for small integers but usually `False` for large ones like `1000`? What is Python doing behind the scenes?\n",
    "6. What does it mean that `x` is a *name* rather than a *variable* in the traditional sense? How is this different from how variables work in C?\n",

    "## Section B - True/False\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Python, `x = 10` stores an integer `10` directly inside `x`.\n",
    "2. Every Python object has a memory address\n",
    "3. `id(x) == id(y)` being `True` means `x is y` is also `True`.\n",
    "4. `x is y` being `True` means `id(x) == id(y)` is also `True`.\n",
    "5. Python caches all integers, so `is` is always safe to use instead of `==`.\n",

    "## 1.3 What Is the Python Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Data Model is the API that allows user-defined objects to integrate seamlessly with Python’s most idiomatic language features.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the data model as a description of Python as a *framework*.\n",
    "It formalizes the interfaces for the core building blocks of the language, such as functions, sequences, iterators, classes, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### A framework perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a framework, we spend much of our time implementing methods that the framework itself calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same idea applies to the Python Data Model.\n",
    "When you define a class, the Python interpreter invokes **special methods** to perform fundamental object operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are usually written using double underscores: `__name__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special methods and syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Special syntax in Python is backed by special methods defined in the data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`obj[key]` is supported by the `__getitem__` special method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating `my_collection[key]`, the interpreter internally calls `my_collection.__getitem__(key)`\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement special methods when we want our objects to support and interact\n",
    "with fundamental language constructs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key idea\n",
    "\n",
